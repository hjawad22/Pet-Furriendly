# Pet Furriendly

## Abstract
Pet Furriendly is a user-friendly application that helps pet owners find nearby pet-friendly locations to visit with their furry friends. By providing specific search criteria, users can easily locate destinations that welcome pets. With just a few clicks, users can access detailed information about each place, including the option to visit the website for additional details. Our goal is to solve the problem that pet owners face by conveniently providing them with a comprehensive list of places where their beloved pets are welcome. Because if you're there, your pets should be there too!
