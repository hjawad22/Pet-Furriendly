## Technologies used
- React
- Router
- Cypress
- Node.js
- Express
- postgreSQL
- pgAdmin
- propType
- CSS
- JSX

## Deployed Pages
- [Backend](https://pet-furriendly-server.onrender.com/api/v1/places)
- Frontend Coming soon 

## Wins
- Getting the initial backend database set up on postgresql through knex.js
- Getting the backend database deployed so fetch calls can be made without running the server locally

## Challenges
The main challenges all revolved around us diving into new technologies that we have never worked with. We worked together as a team to be able to use node.js, express.js and knex.js to create a database on postgresql. The planning and implementing of this process took a few days and lots of research, but ultimately proves successful in the end. 

## Improvements
For this project and the time frame given, the MVP or Minimal Viable Produce we mapped for ourselves was to establish and host a database, then build an application that would use that database to display the data, search through it and select and view individual pieces of data. 

- Going foreward, some ideal extensions would be: 
  - Expanding our database
  - Add a calendar and scheduling feature
  - Expand search field to include zip codes
  - Favoriting locations
  - Rating locations
  - Commenting on locations
