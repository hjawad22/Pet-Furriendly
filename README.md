# Pet Furriendly

## Abstract
Pet Furriendly is a user-friendly application that helps pet owners find nearby pet-friendly locations to visit with their furry friends. By providing specific search criteria, users can easily locate destinations that welcome pets. With just a few clicks, users can access detailed information about each place, including the option to visit the website for additional details. Our goal is to solve the problem that pet owners face by conveniently providing them with a comprehensive list of places where their beloved pets are welcome. Because if you're there, your pets should be there too!

## Context
This application was completed over 7 days in Module3 (week 4) of [Turing School of Software and Design](https://turing.edu/)'s Front End Engineering program. The project was built to match the specifications of [project rubric](https://frontend.turing.edu/projects/module-3/stretch.html).For our stretch tech project, we decided to build a backend for Pet Furriendly. Pet Furriendly incorporated the following:

## Technologies used
- React
- Router
- Cypress
- Node.js
- Express
- postgreSQL
- pgAdmin
- Render
- propType
- CSS
- JSX

## Deployed Pages
- [Backend](https://pet-furriendly-server.onrender.com/api/v1/places)
- Frontend Coming soon 

## Wins
- Getting the initial backend database set up on postgresql through knex.js
- Getting the backend database deployed so fetch calls can be made without running the server locally

## Challenges
The main challenges all revolved around us diving into new technologies that we have never worked with. We worked together as a team to be able to use node.js, express.js and knex.js to create a database on postgresql. The planning and implementing of this process took a few days and lots of research, but ultimately proves successful in the end. 

## Improvements
For this project and the time frame given, the MVP or Minimal Viable Produce we mapped for ourselves was to establish and host a database, then build an application that would use that database to display the data, search through it and select and view individual pieces of data. 

- Going foreward, some ideal extensions would be: 
  - Expanding our database
  - Add a calendar and scheduling feature
  - Expand search field to include zip codes
  - Favoriting locations
  - Rating locations
  - Commenting on locations

## Wins and Challenges
### Wins:
- Demonstrated effective collaboration skills by working together and proactively solving problems.
- Through diligent exploration and planning, we were able to devise an effective strategy to tackle the backend development, enabling us to create a deployed API for the Pet Furriendly application.

### Challenges:
- The process of building a backend for the application presented a significant challenge, as it required careful consideration and planning due to the lack of prior knowledge in this area. To overcome this obstacle, our team engaged in extensive research and thoughtful analysis to determine the most suitable approach for developing the backend infrastructure.
